# Customer Sentiment Dashboard & AI Assistant

This is an advanced single-page application designed to provide deep insights into customer feedback. It leverages powerful AI models to analyze raw text reviews and generates a visual, easy-to-understand dashboard. Additionally, it features a versatile AI assistant with a special "Thinking Mode" for handling complex queries.

The application is built to be model-agnostic, allowing users to switch between different AI providers like Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Mistral on the fly.

### Analyzing Sentiment

1.  Navigate to the **Customer Sentiment Dashboard** section.
2.  Select your preferred AI provider (Google, OpenAI, or Mistral) using the selector buttons.

4.  Click the **Analyze Sentiment** button.

### Using the AI Assistant

1.  Scroll down to the **AI Assistant** section.
2.  Select your desired AI provider.
3.  For complex or creative tasks that require deep reasoning, enable **Thinking Mode**. This will switch to a more powerful model and configuration. The chat history will reset when you change modes or providers.
4.  Type your message in the input field and press `Enter` or click the send button.
5.  The conversation will appear in the chat window. The Google provider supports real-time streaming of responses.

## ðŸ”‘ API Key Configuration

This application is designed to use API keys from environment variables for security.

- **Google Gemini**: The application uses `process.env.API_KEY` to initialize the Google GenAI client in `services/aiService.ts`.
- **OpenAI & Mistral**: To enable these providers, you would need to:
    1.  Add your API keys as environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`).
    2.  Install their respective client SDKs.
    3.  Update the placeholder functions in `services/aiService.ts` to make the actual API calls.
